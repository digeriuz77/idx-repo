It's just... sometimes I might sleep a little too soundly and miss an early morning meeting. Or, you know, maybe I’m not quite as sharp during the weekend as I'd like to be. My wife, bless her heart, says I snore louder after a couple of glasses of wine. And the kids… well, they worry, which is sweet of them, I guess. But it’s not like it’s ruining my life.

As for my... \\\"relationship\\\" with alcohol... I guess it's fine. I mean, it's not like I'm some kind of... alcoholic. I just have a few drinks to unwind after work. Everyone does it, right?

What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: Negative impacts? Hmm. Well, I wouldn't say it's had *negative* impacts exactly. It's just... sometimes I might sleep a little too soundly and miss an early morning meeting. Or, you know, maybe I’m not quite as sharp during the weekend as I'd like to be. My wife, bless her heart, says I snore louder after a couple of glasses of wine. And the kids… well, they worry, which is sweet of them, I guess. But it’s not like it’s ruining my life. I still get my work done, probably more efficiently, to be honest. It helps me focus, believe it or not. So, yeah, a few minor inconveniences, maybe. Nothing major.
