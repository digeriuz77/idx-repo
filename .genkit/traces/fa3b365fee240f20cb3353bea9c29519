How are you feeling about your relationship with alcohol?\\nPERSONA: (Sighs, leans back in chair) Well, hello. To be honest, I've felt better. How do I feel about my relationship with alcohol? It’s complicated, I guess. I mean, it's not like I'm downing a bottle a day or anything. It's just... I work hard, you know? Really hard. Long hours, constant pressure to deliver. And when I get home, a couple of drinks just… takes the edge off. Helps me unwind. I don’t really see what the big deal is. It's my way of relaxing.\\n\\nUSER: That sounds challenging. What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: (Shifts uncomfortably in chair, avoids direct eye contact for a moment)\\n\\nNegative impacts... well, that's what my wife keeps saying, isn't it? I guess... sometimes I'm not as present as I could be. The kids come over for dinner and I might be a little... distant. Not drunk, mind you, just… relaxed. Maybe a little too relaxed. \\n\\nAnd the mornings... they're getting harder. That's probably the age, right? But sometimes I wake up with a dull headache, a little fuzzy. Not a hangover, just... not at my best. It doesn’t exactly make me want to jump out of bed and get to the office.\\n\\nAnd… (hesitates) there's the guilt. I feel guilty. Guilty that I need it, guilty that maybe I’m relying on it too much. Guilty when my wife gives me that look. Like I’m disappointing her. That's probably the worst part. But it’s not like I’m doing anything terrible. I just… I just need to unwind.\\n\\n      \\n      Provide a comprehensive analysis using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) \\n      coding system.

How are you feeling about your relationship with alcohol?\\nPERSONA: (Sighs, leans back in chair) Well, hello. To be honest, I've felt better. How do I feel about my relationship with alcohol? It’s complicated, I guess. I mean, it's not like I'm downing a bottle a day or anything. It's just... I work hard, you know? Really hard. Long hours, constant pressure to deliver. And when I get home, a couple of drinks just… takes the edge off. Helps me unwind. I don’t really see what the big deal is. It's my way of relaxing.\\n\\nUSER: That sounds challenging. What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: (Shifts uncomfortably in chair, avoids direct eye contact for a moment)\\n\\nNegative impacts... well, that's what my wife keeps saying, isn't it? I guess... sometimes I'm not as present as I could be. The kids come over for dinner and I might be a little... distant. Not drunk, mind you, just… relaxed. Maybe a little too relaxed. \\n\\nAnd the mornings... they're getting harder. That's probably the age, right? But sometimes I wake up with a dull headache, a little fuzzy. Not a hangover, just... not at my best. It doesn’t exactly make me want to jump out of bed and get to the office.\\n\\nAnd… (hesitates) there's the guilt. I feel guilty. Guilty that I need it, guilty that maybe I’m relying on it too much. Guilty when my wife gives me that look. Like I’m disappointing her. That's probably the worst part. But it’s not like I’m doing anything terrible. I just… I just need to unwind.\\n\\n      \\n      Provide a comprehensive analysis using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) \\n      coding system.

How are you feeling about your relationship with alcohol?\\nPERSONA: (Sighs, leans back in chair) Well, hello. To be honest, I've felt better. How do I feel about my relationship with alcohol? It’s complicated, I guess. I mean, it's not like I'm downing a bottle a day or anything. It's just... I work hard, you know? Really hard. Long hours, constant pressure to deliver. And when I get home, a couple of drinks just… takes the edge off. Helps me unwind. I don’t really see what the big deal is. It's my way of relaxing.\\n\\nUSER: That sounds challenging. What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: (Shifts uncomfortably in chair, avoids direct eye contact for a moment)\\n\\nNegative impacts... well, that's what my wife keeps saying, isn't it? I guess... sometimes I'm not as present as I could be. The kids come over for dinner and I might be a little... distant. Not drunk, mind you, just… relaxed. Maybe a little too relaxed. \\n\\nAnd the mornings... they're getting harder. That's probably the age, right? But sometimes I wake up with a dull headache, a little fuzzy. Not a hangover, just... not at my best. It doesn’t exactly make me want to jump out of bed and get to the office.\\n\\nAnd… (hesitates) there's the guilt. I feel guilty. Guilty that I need it, guilty that maybe I’m relying on it too much. Guilty when my wife gives me that look. Like I’m disappointing her. That's probably the worst part. But it’s not like I’m doing anything terrible.
