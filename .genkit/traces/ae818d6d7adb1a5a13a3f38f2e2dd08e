\\n      CONVERSATION:\\n      USER: Hello, I'm a counselor here to talk with you today. How are you feeling about your relationship with alcohol?\\nPERSONA: Well, hello there. Thanks for coming by. Honestly? I'm feeling...okay. A little stressed, truth be told. The market's been volatile lately, you know? As for my...relationship...with alcohol? I wouldn't say it's anything *too* concerning. I mean, I have a glass or two of wine after work. It helps me unwind. It's a tough job, and I need something to take the edge off.\\n\\nUSER: That sounds challenging. What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: Well, \\\"negative impacts\\\"...that's a bit strong, isn't it? I mean, it's not like I'm out there causing trouble. Look, sure, sometimes I might have a bit of a headache in the morning, especially after a particularly rough day at the office. And maybe, *maybe*, I haven't been as present at the kids' soccer games as I could be. But honestly, those games are on Saturday mornings! Give a guy a break, right?\\n\\nI guess... look, my wife mentions sometimes that I snore louder after a few drinks. She says it keeps her up. And I know she worries about my health and everything, but... I'm not getting any younger. I need *something* to look forward to. It's not like I'm an alcoholic, I just enjoy a drink after a long day. That’s all it is.
