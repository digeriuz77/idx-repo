How are you feeling about your relationship with alcohol?\\nPERSONA: Well, hello. Thanks for coming. To be honest, I'm feeling a little... targeted. My wife suggested I talk to someone, and well, here we are. My relationship with alcohol? I don't know... it's fine, I guess. I mean, it's not like I'm drinking all day or anything. I have a couple of drinks in the evening. It helps me relax after a long day. This job is incredibly stressful, you know? The deadlines, the pressure... it's relentless. I need something to take the edge off. I just don't know what else I can do.\\n\\nUSER: That sounds challenging. What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: Negative impacts, huh? Well, I suppose… It's not like it's all sunshine and roses, I guess. Sometimes I wake up with a bit of a headache, but that usually goes away after a cup of coffee. And I have noticed my sleep hasn’t been the greatest lately. I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes.\\n\\nLook, I know my wife worries. She says I'm not as \\\"present\\\" in the evenings after I've had a couple. Maybe she's right. I do tend to zone out in front of the TV. But it's not like I’m hurting anyone.\\n\\nHonestly, the biggest problem is probably the guilt. My daughter will sometimes mention how much I drank the night before. It makes me feel bad, because it's true I don't always remember. But I'm just trying to relax. It’s not like I’m out getting into fights or anything. It’s all contained.\\n\\nSo, yeah, maybe a little less sleep, a few headaches, and some nagging. Is that really so bad? I mean, compared to the stress I'm under, it feels like a pretty small price to pay. I’d be an absolute wreck without it.\\n\\n      \\n      Provide a comprehensive analysis using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) \\n      coding system.

How are you feeling about your relationship with alcohol?\\nPERSONA: Well, hello. Thanks for coming. To be honest, I'm feeling a little... targeted. My wife suggested I talk to someone, and well, here we are. My relationship with alcohol? I don't know... it's fine, I guess. I mean, it's not like I'm drinking all day or anything. I have a couple of drinks in the evening. It helps me relax after a long day. This job is incredibly stressful, you know? The deadlines, the pressure... it's relentless. I need something to take the edge off. I just don't know what else I can do.\\n\\nUSER: That sounds challenging. What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: Negative impacts, huh? Well, I suppose… It's not like it's all sunshine and roses, I guess. Sometimes I wake up with a bit of a headache, but that usually goes away after a cup of coffee. And I have noticed my sleep hasn’t been the greatest lately. I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes.\\n\\nLook, I know my wife worries. She says I'm not as \\\"present\\\" in the evenings after I've had a couple. Maybe she's right. I do tend to zone out in front of the TV. But it's not like I’m hurting anyone.\\n\\nHonestly, the biggest problem is probably the guilt. My daughter will sometimes mention how much I drank the night before. It makes me feel bad, because it's true I don't always remember. But I'm just trying to relax. It’s not like I’m out getting into fights or anything. It’s all contained.\\n\\nSo, yeah, maybe a little less sleep, a few headaches, and some nagging. Is that really so bad? I mean, compared to the stress I'm under, it feels like a pretty small price to pay. I’d be an absolute wreck without it.\\n\\n      \\n      Provide a comprehensive analysis using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) \\n      coding system.
