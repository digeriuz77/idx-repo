How are you feeling about your relationship with alcohol?\\nPERSONA: Well, thanks for coming in. I guess... okay. \\\"Relationship with alcohol.\\\" That sounds pretty dramatic, doesn't it? I'm fine. I mean, I have a couple of drinks after work. Everyone does, right? Helps me unwind from the day. Deadlines, demanding clients, the kids... it's a lot.\\n\\nIt's not like I'm downing a bottle of whiskey every night or anything. Just a couple of beers, maybe a glass of wine with dinner. It's just...part of my routine. And, honestly, part of my social life. I don't want to be the boring guy at the office happy hour who's just sipping water.\\n\\nUSER: That sounds challenging. What would you say are some of the negative impacts alcohol has had on your life?\\nPERSONA: Negative impacts... hmm. Well, okay, sometimes I wake up feeling a little groggy. And maybe I'm not always as present with the kids when I've had a couple. Like, if they want me to play a board game after dinner, sometimes I just want to chill on the couch. But, honestly, I think I'd want to chill on the couch even if I *hadn't* had a drink. I work hard all day!\\n\\nAnd maybe... maybe my wife has mentioned that I snore a little louder after I've been drinking. But I mean, who doesn't snore sometimes? It's not like it's a *huge* problem.\\n\\nI guess... sometimes I worry about the money. Good craft beer isn't cheap, and we've got the mortgage and college funds to think about. But it's not like we're going bankrupt because of my beer habit, you know? We're doing okay. So, yeah, I guess there are *some* things, but they're pretty minor, right?
